		<h1>Amazing 5 minutes with Moo Moo the Cat</h1>
		<h2>...interview by Mr. Roche </h2>

		<p>Today, I had the distinct pleasure of interviewing my cat, Moo Moo.  We met over by his food bowl, a crazy colored bowl filled with salmon, his favorite.  He can't talk but he purrs alot and he expresses himself with his face and his paws.  I nearly got scratch during the taking of this interview.</p>


		<h2 id="food">What is your favorite <span id="foodspan">food </span>? Why? </h2>

		<h2> What is your favorite music? Why do you like it?</h2>

		<h2>What is your favorite vacation place?  Why do you have any specific memories that you can share?</h2>

		What is one thing in the world that you would like to accomplish (when you are older?)

		What is one thing in the world that you would like to change?

		What is one thing in the world that makes you most happy?
